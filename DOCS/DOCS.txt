THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTS THE APPROACH TO BUILDING OUT THE API ENDPOINT FUNCTIONALITY AND USER INTERACTION.
THE WORKFLOW AND THE PROTOTYPE IS NOT USABLE, BUT WAS DEVELOPED TO TEST INPUT AND OUTPUT OF DATA TO THE DATABASE .



STEP #1: ADDED MODELS TO THE models.py FILE TO STORE DATA FOR USER, REQUEST, PROPOSAL AND MEALDATE

STEP #2: CHANGED THE CREATE ENGINE DIRECTIVE TO REFLECT THE NAME OF THE DATABASE FOR THE APP

STEP #3: TESTED APP TO SEE IF PAGES LOADED.

STEP #4: CHANGED THE APPROUTES IN THE _INIT__.PY AND THE MODELS.JS

STEP #5: CHANGED SOME STATIC CONTENT ON THE HOME.HTML

STEP #6: TESTED APP IN BROWSER

STEP #7: TEST FAILED - REVERTED TO USING /restaurants APP ROUTE

STEP #8: ADDED THE REST OF MODELS TO THE MODELS.JS CLASS TO REFLECT THE MODELS IN THE DB

STEP #9: CHANGED MAIN TEXT IN JUMBOTRON ELEMENT IN HOME.HTML

STEP #10: TESTED APP IN BROWSER

STEP #11: TEST PASSED - APP WORKS

STEP #12: CREATED USER.HTML FILE TO ALLOW USERS TO REGISTER. 
	 #12: CHANGED THE JUMBOTRON DETAILS
	 #12: CHANGED THE FORM NAME TO NEWUSER-FRM
	 #12: CHANGED THE INPUT ELEMENTS ID AND NAME ATTRIBUTE VALUES
	 #12: CHANGED THE SUBMIT ELEMENT VALUE ATTRIBUTE

STEP #13: CREATED USERLIST.HTML FILE TO DISPLAY LIST IN REVIEWBODY

STEP #14: CREATED EXTENDED INSTANCES FOR THE USER.HTML AND USERLIST.HTML VIEWS IN THE VIEWS.JS FILE.

STEP #15: TEST APP IN BROWSER.

STEP #16: TEST PASSED - APP WORKED WITH MODIFIED VIEWS.JS FILE AND ADDITIONL HTML FILES

STEP #17: MODIFY THE MAIN.JS FILE TO LOAD THE ADDITIONAL USER AND USERLIST HTML TEMPLATES

STEP #18: MODIFY THE MAIN.JS FILE TO LOAD THE "UTT.Views.User" INSTEAD OF THE "UTT.Views.Home" VIEW

STEP #19: TEST PASSED - APP WORKED THE USER VIEW WAS SUBSTITUED IN PLACE OF THE HOME VIEW

STEP #20: CHANGED APP ROUTES IN INIT_PY FILE AND THE USER MODEL AND COLLECTION IN MODELS.JS

STEP #21: MODIFY THE INIT_PY APP ROUTER FILE TO CREATE A METHOD FOR ALL_USERS_HANDLER TO ADD AND RETRIEVE ALL USERS IN THE USER TABLE 
		  THAT MAKES USE OF THE VIEWS CREATED IN STEP 14

STEP #22: FIGURED OUT HOW TO RETRIEVE THE DATA RETURNED FROM THE ALL_USERS_HANDLER TO DISPLAY ON THE PAGE. 
		  THE APPEND METHOD IN THE VIEWS.JS NEEDS TO MAKE REFERENCE TO THE JSONIFIED USERS OBJECT THAT IS CREATED IN THE GET REQUEST OF THE  ALL_uSERS_HANDLER @ LINE 82


VERSION 2: IMPLEMENT ADDITIONAL PAGE TEMPLATES AND FUNCTIONALITY FOR PROPOSAL AND REQUEST 

STEP #23: MAKING A MEAL REQUEST - CREATED THE REQUEST HTML FORM


code for request list
<ul>
			<li>Lets meet up at <b><i> <%= restaurant_name %> </i></b> for <b><i> <%= mealType %> </i></b></li>
			<li>Located <b> <%= restaurant_address %></b> in <b>  <%= location %> </b></li>
			<li>For <b> <%= mealTime %> </b></li>
		</ul>
